# Electron-React-TypeScript-Webpack-Boilerplate
Pre-configured Electron.js + React.js + TypeScript boilerplate with 
Webpack v4 & linters config predefined.

This boilerplate currently works on macOS and Windows. If something doesn't 
work, please [file and issue](https://github.com/Devtography/electron-react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate/issues/new).

## Getting started
```bash
// execute
git clone https://github.com/iamWing/electron-react-typescript-base-proj.git
```

```json
// edit the following fields in package.json for your own project
{
  "name": your-project-name,
  "version": whatever-you-like,
  "description": your-own-description,
  "build": {
    "appId": your-app-id,
    "productName": your-product-name,
    "buildVersion": whatever-you-like
  },
  "author": who's-the-author?,
  "license": if-you-don't-want-to-use-MIT,
  "repository": type-and-link-of-your-repo,
  "keywords": keywords-of-your-project,
  "bugs": issue-page-of-your-repo,
  "homepage": homepage-of-your-repo
}
```

Then install all the `node_modules` needed by executing the following command:
```bash
cd folder-containing-the-cloned-boilerplate
npm run install
```

Finally execute the following command to start Webpack in development mode and 
watch the changes on source files.
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building the installer for your Electron app
The boilerplate is currently configured to package & build the installer of 
your app for macOS & Windows using `electron-builder`. 

For macOS, execute:
```bash
npm run build:mac
```

For Windows, execute:
```bash
npm run build:win
```
_** `asar` archiving is disabled by default in Windows build as it can cause 
errors while running the installed Electron app based on pervious experiences, 
whereas the macOS build with `asar` enabled works just fine. You can turn it 
back on by removing line 23 (`"asar": false`) in `package.json`. **_

### Extra options
The build scripts are pre-configured to build 64 bit installers since 64 bit 
should be the standard for a modern applications. 32 bit builds are still 
possible by changing the build scripts in `package.json` as below:
```json
// from
"scripts": {
    ...
    "build:win": "electron-builder build --win --x64",
    "build:mac": "electron-builder build --mac --x64"
},

// to
"scripts": {
    ...
    "build:win": "electron-builder build --win --ia32",
    "build:mac": "electron-builder build --mac --ia32"
},
```

Builds for Linux, armv71, and arm64 can also be configured by modifying the 
build scripts in `package.json`, but those aren't tested yet. For details, 
please refer to [documents of `electron-builder`](https://www.electron.build/cli).
