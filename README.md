# Electron-React-TypeScript-Webpack-Boilerplate
Pre-configured Electron.js + React.js + TypeScript boilerplate with 
Webpack, Jest & ESLint config predefined.

This boilerplate has been tested on latest macOS and Windows. If anything 
doesn't work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Devtography/electron-react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate/issues/new).

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository, or if you're hosting your Electron project on GitHub,
click [`Use this template`] to create a new project.

2. Edit the following fields in `package.json` for your own project:

    ```json
    {
      "name": your-project-name,
      "version": whatever-you-like,
      "description": your-own-description,
      "build": {
        "appId": your-app-id,
        "productName": your-product-name,
        "buildVersion": your-build-number
      },
      "author": who's-the-author?,
      "license": if-you-don't-want-to-use-MIT,
      "repository": type-and-link-of-your-repo,
      "bugs": issue-page-of-your-repo,
      "homepage": homepage-of-your-repo
    }
    ```

3. `npm install` to install the dependencies.

   *Please note that `optionalDependencies` should only be omitted on your
   CI/CD pipeline for unit testing. It's meant to save some bandwidth. You'll
   need all the packages listed for development.*

Done! Now run `npm run dev` to start the Webpack in development and watch mode.
It's time to start working on your project.

Be aware that starting Webpack will only compile your files to `dist` folder
but won't start the Electron app. Use `npm start` command to start your
Electron app once the files are compiled.

## Build your Electron app package
Different from the official [Electron quick start guide], this boilerplate uses
[`electron-builder`] instead of [Electron Forge] to package your Electron app.

By default, the build configuration in `package.json` is configured to build the
mac universal package (for Apple Silicon & Intel based machines) and Windows
`exe` installer (both 32 & 64 bit). You should not need to change anything in
the build script other than supplying the app icon unless you need to sign your
code/package or build for Linux.

For code signing and notarization, or to build for Linux, please read
[`electron-builder`'s document] for configuring the build script.

To package your Electron app, run `npm run prod` to get your code compiled in
`production` mode, then use `npm run  build:(win|mac)` to build the package.

## Known issues
1. As Apple introduced the [notarization requirements] with the public release
   of `macOS 10.14.5`, apps built for `macOS` are now needed to be signed with
   a valid Developer ID certificate and let Apple notarizes it for you. This
   boilerplate doesn't include the notarization setup as of the `3.0.0` release,
   but up until now, you should still be able to run your Electron app by
   allowing your app to be opened in `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy
   -> General` without notarizing it for still (tested on `macOS 11.1`).

   If you want to notarization your app using this boilerplate before those
   settings are included in the future updates, you can try follow the guides on
   issue [electron-builder #3870].

2. [`electron-builder@22.10.4`] added Apple Silicon and universal binary
   supports, but it's still a pre-release instead of a stable one so the one
   included in this boilerplate is still staying on `22.9.1` which doesn't
   support building the universal binary yet.
