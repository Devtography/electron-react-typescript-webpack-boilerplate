# Code of Conduct

We know that the general code of conduct document is boring, lengthy, and likely too formal that 99% of you wouldn't read it, so we're keeping it short and simple here:

- Be kind, be nice, and be polite. Harassment, trolling, bullying or any insulting posts/comments are strictly prohibited.

Project maintainers reserve the rights to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

That's it. Happy coding.
